## Virtual Pet Project
- create a VirtualPet class
- create a VirtualPetApp class with a main method
- create a VirtualPetTest class to build out unit tests on the behaviors placed in VirtualPet
- House the projcet in a properly named package (not default)

### To dos!
	- Make a game/time loop
	-- include a tick()
	
	- Include the following attributes and ways to eleviate it (at least 3)
	-- hunger (feed it)
	-- thirst (water it)
	-- waste (clean up/letit it out)
	-- boredom (play with pet)
	-- health (give it meds if sick)

### ideas
	- Over feeding (above a given hunger level) will make the animal sick (max out waste and increase sickness level)
	- Over watering will make it pee (max out waste)
	- Overdose on meds kills it
	- dark humor about putting to sleep
	- if pet is bored it will randomly increase it's boredome score by imaination/ball?
	- visual rep of pet
	- favorite food/toy?
